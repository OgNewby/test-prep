   <p> The TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) is widely regarded as one of the best tests for determining your English language skills. When you decide to study abroad, which opens up various job prospects, it is critical to understand the standards for admission to institutions overseas. When applying to a university in a country where English is the native language and the mode of instruction is the same, you must pass an entrance exam such as the TOEFL to demonstrate that you have the necessary strong English language skills to survive the competition and effectively communicate your ideas.
